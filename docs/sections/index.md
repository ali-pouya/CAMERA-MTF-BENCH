## How to Use This Site

- Start with the **Introduction** and **System Overview** for context.
- Dive into **Siemens vs Slanted Edge** and **Autofocus Metrics** for the core theory.
- Use **Software Modules**, **CLI**, and **Manual Focus Workflow** when working with the code.
- Refer to **Advanced Topics** and **Appendix** for deeper optical and mathematical details.

This documentation is meant to serve both as a practical guide for running the bench and as a technical reference for optical engineers evaluating imaging systems.
